## Projects

- Designed a Surveillance UAV utilizing data analytics and thermal image processing techniques such as HOG and YOLO for human detection. Achieved a 90% accuracy in detecting humans after training and testing the algorithm with multiple scenarios of OTCVS Benchmark data set. (2019-2020).  
- E-Yantra Robotics  
    - Built a smart Transporter bot with Firebird-V which used ATMEL microcontroller. The bot mimicked harvesting and transportation by navigating to locate and transport 6 objects using coordinates map with ZigBee communication.  
    - Achieved task using a functioning obstacle detection system with sensors and 3 actuators to pick up objects. Analyzed data collected from the robot’s sensors for color detection to optimize performance (2017-2018).  
    - Imitated pollination of a flower through Pluto drone. Recreated the flowers using 4 led circuits of different colors. The drone navigated the arena with camera-based image recognition (2018-2019).
- Implemented search algorithms, reinforcement learning and probabilistic inference in Pac-man projects by UC-Berkeley. Constructed knowledge base with 18 propositional logic modules for Wumpus world (Aug-Dec 2022).
- Applied image processing algorithms such as contour detection, edge detection, histogram enhancement, and negatives in Matlab to develop a people counter utilizing pixel counting and scanning. (Nov 2019).
- Created a Harvester bot with 80% hit rate to mimic harvesting of ripe fruits using color recognition, Arduino and Sensors.
- Implemented smart vertical farming with 100 % automated monitoring system to increase yield with minimal management. This solution involved transferring data to cloud using BOLT IoT, enabling remote data analysis (Mar 2018).
