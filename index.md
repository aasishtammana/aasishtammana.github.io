|<p>Deloitte India (Offices of the US) - Consulting Bangalore •</p><p>Business Technology Analyst, Analytics and Cognitive Aug 2020 - Jul 2022</p><p>- Conducted a full life cycle analysis of requirements, activities, and design through client engagements.</p><p>- Developed over 20 reports containing different timeline charts and key performance indicator cards for visualization using Power BI DAX Syntax, SQL queries(Databricks Spark), data models. Held demo sessions for knowledge transfer.</p><p>- Maintained technical design documents, repositories, and upheld code quality of data team with 100% accuracy.</p><p>- Directed User Acceptance Testing to implement 200+ key propositions, optimized performance, and increased efficiency</p><p>of 25+ client dashboards related to Procurement, Legal, Security, Digital Advisory Board, and Travel by 40%.</p><p>- Retrieved, aggregated, cleansed and analyzed vast amounts of data from public web sources for 8 countries using data mining, population sizing, excel macros and automated scripts to support effective decision making.</p><p>- Compiled the data using inferential statistics and time series analysis to generate actionable business insights.</p><p>- Acquired 1 terabyte data from primary and secondary data sources and maintained databases/data systems. Handled the</p><p>extraction, transformation and load processes to streamline data and connect to Power BI.</p><p>- Scheduled and supervised tidal jobs for 100% workload automation of data loads through data pipelines.</p><p>Nokia Solutions and Networks Bangalore •</p><p>Student Intern, Cloud Core Platform Mar 2020 - Aug 2020</p><p>- Revamped a tool from go language to python to accept a Template Call Session Control Function (CSCF) file used for managing signaling from end users to generate 10 generic XML’s and eliminate manual efforts.</p><p>- Wrote Bash scripts to perform md5 check for 4 file systems to ensure information is in same state.</p><p>- Completed Nokia IOT course on wireless perspectives with Outstanding grade(90+) (May 2019).</p><p>- Received Appreciation award for implementing and demonstrating a pothole detector and Mapping bot in 3 days using Arduino, gyroscope and UV sensors (Sep 2018).</p><p>Projects</p>|
|<p>- Designed a Surveillance UAV utilizing data analytics and thermal image processing techniques such as HOG and YOLO for human detection. Achieved a 90% accuracy in detecting humans after training and testing the algorithm with multiple scenarios of OTCVS Benchmark data set. (2019-2020).</p><p>- E-Yantra Robotics</p><p>- Built a smart Transporter bot with Firebird-V which used ATMEL microcontroller. The bot mimicked harvesting and transportation by navigating to locate and transport 6 objects using coordinates map with ZigBee communication.</p><p>- Achieved task using a functioning obstacle detection system with sensors and 3 actuators to pick up objects. Analyzed data collected from the robot’s sensors for color detection to optimize performance (2017-2018).</p><p>- Imitated pollination of a flower through Pluto drone. Recreated the flowers using 4 led circuits of different colors. The drone navigated the arena with camera-based image recognition (2018-2019).</p><p>- Implemented search algorithms, reinforcement learning and probabilistic inference in Pac-man projects by UC-Berkeley. Constructed knowledge base with 18 propositional logic modules for Wumpus world (Aug-Dec 2022).</p><p>- Applied image processing algorithms such as contour detection, edge detection, histogram enhancement, and negatives in Matlab to develop a people counter utilizing pixel counting and scanning. (Nov 2019).</p><p>- Created a Harvester bot with 80% hit rate to mimic harvesting of ripe fruits using color recognition, Arduino and Sensors.</p><p>- Implemented smart vertical farming with 100 % automated monitoring system to increase yield with minimal management. This solution involved transferring data to cloud using BOLT IoT, enabling remote data analysis (Mar 2018).</p><p>Skills Summary</p>|
